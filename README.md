# Updated-Portfolio
Homework #8

Welcome to the beginning of my career as a developer. This is my Portfolio that includes multiple project I have done and or been apart of with the clickable boxes in my Work section. You will also see a little of what I am capable with this portfolio website. If you see any potential, then I would love to talk about how we could help each other out. You can reach me at any one of my Contact Me resources and I will do my best to get back to you as fast as I can. 

One more thing I need to add to my Portfolio is a hamburger menu as well as touch up my sections and include some more about who I have worked with.
